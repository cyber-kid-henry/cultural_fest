Along with long-time crusader Mr. Afroz Shah who is acknowledged as a United Nations’ Champion of the Earth, Parvaah has organized weekend cleanup drives at Versova beach. It’s an attempt to restore the pride of the beach and make it pristine again. If one wants to bring about a change, then it must come from within oneself, and this is a wonderful opportunity to restore the pride of the city and send a message to the society regarding importance of cleanliness.</p>
